# 🛠️ Technical Context: Foundation Before Change
## Baseline code structure in early July 2025

Before our major updates, the project ecosystem was relatively simple. The CLI and main index logic lived in core files, with limited flexibility in how presentations could be generated. No support existed for presentation styles or for customizing output behavior via prompts, command-line modifiers, or configuration files. 

Updates to `package.json` and `package-lock.json` in versions 1.0.5 and 1.0.6 were basic, reflecting no architectural changes or new features. The foundation was functional, but lacked extensibility for more sophisticated presentation workflows.

# 🚀 Implementation Journey: Introducing the Hybrid Prompt System
## A leap to modular, extensible presentation generation

With the feature commit for the hybrid prompt system, we engineered a step-change in flexibility and capability. Over 600 lines of new or refactored logic were added and distributed across new and updated files. The core advancements:

- NEW `prompts/` directory: Segregated all prompt logic into coherent style modules (technical, executive, retrospective, and more).
- CLI (`bin/cli.js`) updates: Enhanced parsing to support configuration files (`--config`), direct custom prompt scripts, and powerful inline flags (`--focus`, `--deep-dive`, etc.).
- The index module (`src/index.js`) became responsible for orchestrating style selection, configuration lookup, and precedence resolution.
- Documentation: The README overhaul ensured developers could onboard rapidly with new features and their use-cases.

# 🏗️ Architectural Decisions: Patterns & Rationale
## Why modular prompts and a CLI-first interface?

We embraced a **modular architecture** by extracting prompt logic into individual files under a dedicated `prompts/` folder. This enabled separation of concerns, simplified feature testing, and opened the door for user-contributed or custom styles. 

The CLI serving as the main configuration gateway aligns with Unix philosophies: it allows shell-based automation, scripting, and explicit developer intent.

The **priority system**—custom > config file > style > modifiers > default—offers predictable, overridable behavior, which is crucial for enterprise use cases. This architectural approach set us up for both scale and maintainability.

# 💡 Code Quality and Trade-offs: What Changed?
## Enhancing clarity and future extensibility

Extracting prompts into their own modules reduced cognitive load and made each presentation style independently maintainable. It also exposed an opportunity: as more styles are added, testing and documentation must keep pace to avoid fragmentation.

**Trade-off:** The CLI grew in complexity, introducing more logic branches and edge cases, particularly in flag parsing.

**Example:**
```js
// prompts/technicalDeepDive.js
module.exports = function(opts) {
  // Implements deep-dive technical narration
  ...
};
```

Renaming `--raw` to `--skip-ai` illustrates our commitment to semantic clarity and forward compatibility, prioritizing intuitive developer ergonomics.

# ⚡ Technical Outcomes: New Capabilities
## What the new system unlocks for developers

The hybrid prompt system delivers:

- **Multiple built-in styles** (technical, executive, retrospective), each reusable and extensible
- **Drop-in custom prompt scripts** via the CLI, supporting user-specific logic
- **Config file support** for easy sharing of complex setup
- **Inline modifiers:** instant, granular tweaking of output
- **Documentation & help:** vastly improved onboarding and discoverability

This results in a toolchain that adapts to any stakeholder—be it developer, executive, or retrospectives—without requiring code-level changes to support new formats.

# 🔎 Before vs. After: Flexibility Comparison
## How did extensibility evolve?

### Before
- Single hardcoded prompt style
- No config or modifier support
- Poor for scaling presentation types

::right::

### After
- Modular `prompts/` architecture
- CLI with config, custom script, and inline override
- Priority system for option resolution
- New styles easily pluggable

# 🔬 Remaining Gaps & Technical Debt
## Risks, quality, and next steps

The July 2025 change set prioritized new capability over technical debt reduction:
- **No refactoring or test changes** were included
- **No explicit code quality improvements**—future work should add test coverage for each prompt module and robust CLI parsing validation
- Architectural decisions were sound but will require periodic review as the number of prompt styles grows

**Known risk:** Without automated tests, regressions in prompt logic and CLI parsing could occur as the codebase scales further.

# 🌟 The Outcome & Future Direction
## A platform for flexible, developer-first presentation generation

**In summary:**

With the hybrid prompt system, we architected a highly modular, developer-friendly framework for presentation generation. The evolution from a simple, single-style generator to an extensible platform has prepared us for:

- Rapid introduction of new presentation styles
- Easier community or customer customization
- Robust, scriptable CLI workflows

**Next steps:** Focus on code quality improvements, automated testing, and ongoing documentation to ensure long-term maintainability.
